G'athruloisteen'nir G'athruweyrénir
=
the powerful man with the powerful crystal

[] means that it is implied

let's split it up into
(g'a)(thru)(loisteen')(nir) (g'a)(thru)(weyré)(nir)

(g'a) = the
(thru) = power
(loisteen) = crystal
(nir) = has
(weyre) = man

so:
(g'a)(thru)         (loisteen')(nir) =
(the)(power)[that the](crystal)(has) =
     (power)[that the](crystal)(has) =
the crystal that has power =
the powerful crystal
and:
(g'a)(thru)         (weyré)(nir) = 
(the)(power)[that the](man)(has) =
     (power)[that the](man)(has) =
the man that mas power =
the powerful man

depracticed:
G'athruloisteen'nir kaja G'athruweyrénir
(g'a)(thru)          (loisteen')(nir) (kaja) (g'a)(thru)          (weyré)(nir) =
(the)(power)[that]     (crystal)(has) (that) (the)(power)[that]     (man)(has) =
     (power)[that](the)(crystal)(has) (that)      (power)[that](the)(man)(has) =
the crystal that has power that the man that mas power [has] =
the powerful crystal that the powerful man [has] =
the powerful man that has the powerful crystal

so:
G'athruweyrénir kaja'nir G'athruloisteen'nir
(g'a)(thru)          (weyré)(nir) (kaja)(nir) (g'a)(thru)          (loisteen')(nir)[nir] =
(the)(power)[that]     (man)(has) (that)(has) (the)(power)[that]     (crystal)(has)[has] =
     (power)[that](the)(man)(has) (that)(has)      (power)[that](the)(crystal)(has)[has] =
the man that has power that has the crystal that has power =
the powerful man that has the powerful crystal

and it could also be written as:
G'athruloisteen'nir kaja G'athruweyrénir[nir] =
G'uweyre kaja thrunir kaja'nir G'aloisteen kaja thrunir

also:
G'adora thrunir
(g'a)(dora)  (thru)(nir)
(the)(world)(power)(has)
the world has power
but should generally be:
G'adora d'uthrunir
(g'a)(dora)   (d'u)(thru)(nir)
(the)(world)(some)(power)(has)
the world has ~~some~~ power

G'uweyre kaja thrunir = G'uweyre kaja'nir D'uthru
(g'a)(weyre) (kaja) (thru)(nir)
(the)(man)   (that)(power)(has)
the man that has power
