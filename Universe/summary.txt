So the stories are split into several "arcs":

Arc 1 is the story of a rebellion in the **Empire of Gadora** that brings the **Unon** family to power. A group of political extremists, known as the **Brothers Karok** or the Shadow Brotherhood, are discontent with the Unon's rule, and matters eventually escalate into a bloody civil war. The Unon Emperor, **Omaroth**, and his wife **Silduro** are assassinated by members of the Brotherhood, but their son **Thrunir** becomes the new Emperor and leads the Empire to victory. The leaders of the Brotherhood are exiled and the Empire is left to rebuild itself.
